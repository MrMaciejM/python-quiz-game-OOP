# Python Quiz Game built with OOP in mind

## What did I build this project?
I have built this project to remind myself of the OOP in Python.

Another aim of this project was to showcase the intermediate knowledge
of Python needed to build the quiz game while adhering to the OOP, 
data types (lists, objects), and clean code principles.

I was careful in adhering to professional standards while writing the 
code for this simple game, and making sure that the code is modular 
and without unnecessary code repetitions (DRY).
